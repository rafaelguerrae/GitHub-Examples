### Hello, this is my first time really writing a .markdown file

## this should be smaller

# this is the smallest

` console.log("My name is Rafael"); `

> What is this used for

# This should be a ordered list:
    1. Hello
    1. Hello 2
    3. Hello 3


# Same thing but unordered:
    - Hello
    - Hello 2
    - Hello 3
